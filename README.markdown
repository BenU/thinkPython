## Personal Repository for my Exercises in Allan Downey's [Think Python](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/index.html) 

I created this repository so that I could work on [Allan Downey's](http://greenteapress.com) great ["Python for Software Design - Think Like a Computer Scientist"](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/index.html) on both my desktop and laptop.  Available on [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0521725968?tag=greenteapre01-20&camp=213381&creative=390973&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=0521725968&adid=1RNQ6KVJC690DFN7E0QQ&&ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Fgreenteapress.com%2F) or as free, open-sourced download from [Downey's website at http://greenteapress.com](http://greenteapress.com)    

My goal up to this point has been to work through the book as quickly as possible and move on to Professor Downey's more advanced python books on [stats](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/index.html) and [complexity](http://greenteapress.com/complexity/index.html).  As of 02012-02-24 I have made it to Chapter 13, section 13.3.  Since others may take a look at this code, from here on I will attempt to better organize it with appropriate folder and file names with references to specific sections in Downey's book.
